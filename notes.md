What is asked-
 We need new fonts -----
 we need to account for 5% of the browsers
 we need to add icons to the set up
 we need to set up the toggle menu in the bottom footer
 Set up slide functionality

1) included the fonts
2) Added some min device specific pixel for retina displays
3) Added a shopping cart icon and search bar button.
4) all social media icons put in. Not sure if they want the actual text or just the icon.
5) added mobile responsiveness
6) Added some footer effects for the links.....
7) if given more time would have redone entire website to make it flexbox. and then added all responsiveness through flex box.


So upon first reading the description and what the client was asking for, I had to dive into the HTML and CSS to see what was actually happening on the page.

First, the icons were missing for: search bar, all social media sites, and the shopping cart. I was able to add those by just including the JPG files provided in the image folder.

Then I went into the fonts. From what I noticed the fonts were being called in the CSS file. So I had to include the fonts from google in order for the HTML to know the client wants to have those fonts.

The next step was to make the menu collapsable so making it a more interactive and mobile friendly menu. I had to write some JQuery in order for us to have the menu

Then for the more challening part of the project. Making the website responsive to various types of browsers and screen sizes. I had to include different types of media queries to make sure that the site is recognizing. I was able to make the menu appear vertical when switching over to a smaller screen. Also I got rid of some of the content in order to appear mobile friendly. The slideshow is no longer available on mobile.

To improve the UI/UX interface moving forward. I would highly recommend switching the CSS and styling over to "Flex Box". It would have been very intuitive making it responsive to mobile and various screen sizes.
